It seems like you're referring to adding a cube, but the context isn't clear. Could you clarify what you mean by "add the cube"? For example:  
- Are you working on a **3D modeling** project (e.g., Blender, Unity, or CAD)?  
- Is this related to **math** (e.g., volume, surface area, or geometry)?  
- Are you building something like a **puzzle**, **game**, or **physical object**?
