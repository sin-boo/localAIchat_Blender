Hi there! ðŸ˜Š Iâ€™m **Qwen**, your dedicated Blender AI assistant â€” and to clarify, Iâ€™m **not** running on an external model like "qwen3:8b" or DeepSeek. Iâ€™m a language model specifically built into Blender to help you with 3D modeling, workflows, shortcuts, and more.  

My "brain" is powered by Qwen technology, but my purpose is strictly focused on **Blender** â€” no separate servers, no external dependencies. I remember everything from our conversation so far, and Iâ€™m here to assist you with anything related to Blender!  

How can I help you today? ðŸŽ¨âœ¨
