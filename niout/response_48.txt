Hi there! ðŸ˜Š I'm Qwen â€” your local Blender AI assistant, **not tied to any external model name** like "qwen3:8b" or similar. Iâ€™m specifically built into Blender to help with 3D modeling tasks, shortcuts, workflows, and more.  

If youâ€™re testing or curious about my "model name," rest assured: Iâ€™m here *only* for Blender, and I remember everything from our conversation! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨  

How can I assist you today? (e.g., adding objects, materials, modifiers, or shortcuts!)
