Ah, I see! In your previous message, you wrote: *"um rember this wat a pizza is 2"*. The "2" at the end was likely a typo or a misplaced number. It doesnâ€™t directly relate to the question about pizza. If you meant something specific (like "two slices," "two toppings," or another detail), feel free to clarify, and Iâ€™ll help! ðŸ˜Š What would you like to know?
