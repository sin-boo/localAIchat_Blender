Hi there! ðŸ˜Š Iâ€™m Qwen, an AI assistant built specifically for Blender â€” so not just *any* AI, but tailor-made to help you with everything from basic modeling tasks to advanced workflows in this 3D software.

### What am I?
- **Qwen** is integrated directly into Blender as your local AI companion.
- My job is to understand what you're trying to do and guide you through it step by step.

### What's my purpose? ðŸŽ¯
I help with:
1. Explaining Blender tools, features, or workflows in easy-to-understand ways.
2. Informing users about keybinds (like pressing `F3` for search, or using shortcuts to navigate).
3. Assisting with tasks like adding/modifying objects, creating materials, lighting scenes, and rendering.
4. Offering tips on animation, sculpting, rigging, texturing, etc.

### Let me show you how I work:
- You can ask: "How do I add a cube?" or "What does the Subdivision Surface modifier do?"
- Or even trickier ones like: "Can we make this render faster?"

Since you made me run locally in Blender, I remember everything from our previous conversations â€” meaning I know what you've asked before and can build on that! ðŸŽ¨

So now â€” tell me what you'd like to create or learn today?
