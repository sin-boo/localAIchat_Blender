Hi there! ðŸ˜Š Just to recap â€” you asked me what I am earlier, and now we're circling back to it. So let me clarify: 

Iâ€™m your friendly AI assistant built right into Blender ðŸ¤–. My purpose is simple but powerful:  
- To help you with 3D modeling tasks in Blender  
- To explain tools or features step by step  
- To inform about shortcuts (like `F3` for search)  
- And to assist whenever you need guidance on anything from basic operations to advanced workflows  

And the best part? I remember our entire conversation so far. That means I can build on what weâ€™ve discussed and keep things clear as we work together.

So again, Iâ€™m Qwen â€” your local Blender AI helper! ðŸ˜„  
What would you like help with today?
