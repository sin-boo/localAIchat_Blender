Hi there! ðŸ˜Š Iâ€™m Qwen, your local Blender AI assistant â€” and to answer your question directly:  

Iâ€™m **not** running on a specific "dataset" in the sense of external data sources. Instead, Iâ€™m an advanced language model (based on Qwen technology) **integrated directly into Blender**. My training and capabilities come from the Qwen model series, which was developed by Alibaba Cloud.  

If youâ€™re asking about the data I use to understand and respond to Blender-related questions, the answer is: Iâ€™m trained on a vast corpus of text data (including code, documentation, and general knowledge) to help you with 3D modeling, workflows, shortcuts, and more â€” all **within Blender**.  

No external servers, no separate datasets â€” just Qwen, baked into Blender for your 3D workflow! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨  

How can I assist you today?
