It seems there might be a typo in your question. Could you clarify what you mean by "ruing"? For example:

1. **If you meant "ruining"**: Are you asking if I'm causing harm or damage at 100% capacity?  
2. **If you meant "ruling"**: Are you asking if I'm making decisions or taking control at full capacity?  
3. **If you meant "rueing"**: Are you asking if I'm feeling regret or sorrow at 100%?
