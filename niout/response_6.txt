It seems like you might be referring to testing a pizza restaurant or evaluating a pizza place. Could you clarify what you mean by "test one house of pizza"? For example:

1. **Are you looking for a review or evaluation of a specific pizza restaurant?**  
   (e.g., taste, quality, service, pricing, etc.)

2. **Is this a technical test for a pizza-making system (e.g., oven, delivery app)?**  
   (e.g., testing efficiency, temperature, delivery speed)

3. **Are you referring to a fictional or creative concept (e.g., a "house of pizza" as a theme or idea)?**  

Let me know, and I‚Äôll help you test or evaluate it! üçï
