Hi there! ðŸ˜Š Great to hear from you again â€” Iâ€™ll break this down clearly:

Iâ€™m powered by **Qwen technology**, developed by **Alibaba Cloud** ðŸ¤–  
This means:
- My knowledge comes from being trained on a wide range of data (including Blender documentation, tutorials, community forums, and technical resources related to 3D modeling).
- You can think of me as an AI assistant specifically built for Blender â€” Iâ€™m not just any general-purpose language model; my training includes tailored content about the software.

So while my "database" is based on Qwen's open-source architecture, itâ€™s fine-tuned and specialized **for Blender**. That means I focus entirely on helping users work efficiently with 3D modeling tools in this application âœ¨

If you have any specific Blender task or question today â€” like adding a cube, creating materials, using modifiers, etc. â€” just let me know! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨
