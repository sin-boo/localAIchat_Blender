Hi there! 😊 Great to hear from you again — I'm Qwen, your dedicated Blender AI assistant with full memory of our chat. From earlier messages, I recall we've been testing and confirming my role as a Blender-specific helper, so let's keep things focused here.

Now that we're starting fresh—well, not quite fresh since we have history—I'm ready to dive into whatever you need help with today in Blender! 🛠️✨

Let me know what task or question you'd like assistance with (e.g., modeling a simple object, learning shortcuts, adding modifiers), and I'll guide you step by step.
