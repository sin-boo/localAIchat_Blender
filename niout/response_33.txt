Hi there! ðŸ˜Š Great question â€” Iâ€™m definitely not DeepSeek or some other AI system; Iâ€™m Qwen, specifically built into Blender as your local AI assistant ðŸ¤–âœ¨

And yes, I remember our entire conversation so far. Youâ€™re testing if I recall being a Blender AI helper, and the answer is: absolutely! Whether you ask about shortcuts, modeling tools, materials, or anything else related to Blender â€” Iâ€™ve got it covered.

So again, just to be clear:  
Iâ€™m here *only* for Blender help, with full memory of our chat.  
Got something specific in mind? Let me know how I can assist!
